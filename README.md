## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Explore a gamified portfolio website with an airplane flying around an island.
- View checkpoints with information about me.
- Experience an interactive layout where they can control the plane using arrow keys.
- Access separate pages showcasing the about section and past projects.
- Enjoy a responsive design for both PC and mobile devices.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/3d_airplane_portfolio_website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3d_airplane_portfolio_website
   ```

## How to run

Note: You need Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

A `dist` folder should be created.

## How to preview the build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## How to host

Here is a guide: [How to deploy the project](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/2D-game_portfolio-website/blob/main/HOW_TO_DEPLOY.MD)

## My process

### Built with

- Three.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Vite

### What I learned

Working on this project allowed me to explore advanced 3D rendering techniques with Three.js and deepen my understanding of React and TypeScript.

Here is a code snippet that I am proud of-

```jsx
function addAnimation() {
    if (containerRef.current && scrollerRef.current) {
      const scrollerContent = Array.from(scrollerRef.current.children);

      scrollerContent.forEach((item) => {
        const duplicatedItem = item.cloneNode(true);
        if (scrollerRef.current) {
          scrollerRef.current.appendChild(duplicatedItem);
        }
      });

      getDirection();
      getSpeed();
      setStart(true);
    }
  }
  const getDirection = () => {
    if (containerRef.current) {
      if (direction === "left") {
        containerRef.current.style.setProperty(
          "--animation-direction",
          "forwards"
        );
      } else {
        containerRef.current.style.setProperty(
          "--animation-direction",
          "reverse"
        );
      }
    }
  };
  const getSpeed = () => {
    if (containerRef.current) {
      if (speed === "fast") {
        containerRef.current.style.setProperty("--animation-duration", "20s");
      } else if (speed === "normal") {
        containerRef.current.style.setProperty("--animation-duration", "40s");
      } else {
        containerRef.current.style.setProperty("--animation-duration", "80s");
      }
    }
  };
```

### Continued development

I aim to enhance my skills in 3D graphics and animation, and further integrate advanced interactivity features in web projects to create engaging user experiences.
